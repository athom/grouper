Here is the relationship between go packages and the architecture layers.

- grouper: Entities&UseCases
- web: Controller & Web infrastrure
- storage: DB

### Requirements

- Setup mysql

```
mysql -h <your_host> -p<port> -u<username> -p<password> -e 'CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS grouper;'
```

- Go packages

install [govendoer](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) first, then exec

```$xslt
govendor sync
```

### Run the test

#### Prepare the DB
```$xslt
mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS grouper_test;'
```

#### Trigger test cases

```$xslt
./test.sh
```

### Run the App

#### 1. Run from source code 

Go to project root, setup config in `$project_root/cmd/grouper/config.json`

```$xslt
{
	"storage_type": "mysql",
	"port": <app_port>,
	"mysql_settings": {
		"host": "your_fancy_host",
		"port": <db_port>,
		"username": "your_fancy_username",
		"password": "your_password",
		"database": "your_database"
	}
}
```

Run server.

```$xslt
go run cmd/grouper/main.go
```


#### 2. Try it from demo site (temporary available)

```$xslt
curl -d '{"email": "andy@example.com"}' http://119.28.1.61:7200/v1/friends/find

curl -d '{"email": "john@example.com"}' http://119.28.1.61:7200/v1/friends/find

curl -d '{"friends": ["athom@example.com", "john@example.com"]}' http://119.28.1.61:7200/v1/friends/common
```
